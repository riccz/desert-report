This folder contains a set of ambient light optical noise LUTs, obtained by employing Hydrolight in different scenarios. 

Inside each scenario folder there is an info file, containing the information about the partition of the attenuation coefficient (c) in absorption (a) and scattering (b) of the LUTs.

Each file name gives details about the water conditions:
-->PcXX_depthYY.ascii
   - YY is the water column depth
   - XX is the pattern referring to the attenuation coefficient
