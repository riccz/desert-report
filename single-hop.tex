The single-hop network uses a CBR source that transmits to a CBR sink
using a TDMA MAC and a Hermes PHY.

Let $L_p = 1000+4$ and $L_a = 24+4$ be the size of the packet and of the
ACK at the data-link layer.

If the ARQ is disabled, the source is the only node that transmits
over the channel, so the throughput will be the PHY bitrate (the same
as the the DL bitrate since the TDMA does not add any header) times
the PDR.

The highest bitrate of the Hermes modems is \SI{150}{kb\per\s}, which
becomes $r = \SI{87.768}{kb\per\s}$ of information rate taking into
account the BCH coding, the training sequence that preceeds each frame
and the 32-bit CRC.

The PDR of the Hermes modem is measured in the case of full frames
(9120 informtion bits + 32 bits of CRC) at certain distances and
linearly interpolated. Then, assuming that each 11-bit word is wrong
with probability $p_{word}$ independently from the others, we can
compute the packet error rate for a packet of $N_{pkt}$ words as
\begin{equation}
  p_{pkt} = p_{word}^{N_{pkt}} = p_{frame}^{\frac{N_{pkt}}{N_{frame}}}
\end{equation}

{\color{red} what about the 32-bit CRC? $N{pkt} = \ceil{L/11}$ in the
  code, but the CRC must also be received correctly}

The maximum achievable throughput is
\begin{equation}
  S = r p_{pkt}
\end{equation}
at a distance of \SI{50}{\m} the throughput is $S \approx
\SI{77.24}{kb\per\s}$

The simulation results are close to this value.

{\color{red} The PDR of Hermes is measured at a depth of 0.5m, other
  params for the propagation?}
